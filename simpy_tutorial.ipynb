    "SimPy is a discrete-event simulation library. The behavior of active components (like vehicles, customers or messages) is modeled with **processes**. All processes live in an **environment**. They interact with the environment and with each other via **events**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Processes are described by simple Python generators. During their lifetime, they create events and **yield** them in order to wait for them to be triggered.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a process yields an event, the process gets suspended. SimPy resumes the process when the event occurs (we say that the event is triggered). Multiple processes can wait for the same event. SimPy resumes them in the same order in which they yielded that event.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important event type is the `Timeout`. Events of this type are triggered after a certain amount of (simulated) time has passed. They allow a process to sleep (or hold its state) for the given time. A `Timeout` and all other events can be created by calling the appropriate method of the `Environment` that the process lives in (`Environment.timeout()` for example)."
